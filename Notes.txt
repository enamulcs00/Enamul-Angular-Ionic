Subject: Clarification on Bug Reassignment

Hi [Bug Reporter's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I noticed that you recently reassigned a resolved bug to me, and I wanted to reach out to clarify the situation. If there is indeed a genuine issue that needs to be addressed, I'd appreciate it if you could provide further details or perhaps attach a screenshot to help me better understand the nature of the bug.

Clear documentation and context are crucial for effective bug resolution, so any additional information you can provide would be immensely helpful. Once I have a clearer understanding of the issue, I'll be better equipped to investigate and address it promptly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
