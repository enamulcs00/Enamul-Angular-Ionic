ySubject: Revision Needed for TMS HLD - Base Issue Identified

Hi Inayat,

I hope this message finds you well.

Upon a thorough review of the TMS High-Level Design (HLD), I have identified a fundamental issue with the base structure. Unfortunately, this issue necessitates a comprehensive revision of the entire code.

Given the extent of the changes required, this process will take some time to complete. I will keep you updated on our progress and any developments as we proceed with the necessary revisions.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as we work through this.

Best regards,
