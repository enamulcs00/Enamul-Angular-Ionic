Subject: Request to Restart VM #WKSP00118B50

Hi [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out to inform you that my VM, identified as #WKSP00118B50, has been switched off. I attempted to contact the NOC multiple times at the provided number, 1-866-662-4877, but it seems that the number is invalid. This number was given to me by the UPS helpdesk team.

Given the urgency of the situation, could you please assist in restarting the VM on your level? Your help would be greatly appreciated as it is impacting my ability to complete my tasks.

Please let me know if you need any further information from my end.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
