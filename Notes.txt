Subject: Emergency Leave Request from 9th to 13th September 2024

Dear [Manager/Team Lead's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that I will need to take emergency leave from 9th September 2024 to 13th September 2024. My father has been experiencing significant hand pain for the past 3-4 months, and I need to consult with a doctor regarding his treatment during this period.

For this leave, I would like to utilize my comp off leave. I have ensured that all my current tasks are up to date, and I will coordinate with the team to ensure a smooth workflow in my absence. If there are any urgent matters, please feel free to reach out to me via phone or email.

Thank you for your understanding and support in this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Position]
