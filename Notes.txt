Dear [Manager Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am experiencing significant performance issues with the virtual machine (VM) I am currently using. The VM is running very slow and frequently freezing, which is causing major disruptions to my work.

These freezes completely halt my ability to work, significantly impacting my productivity. 

I kindly request your assistance in resolving this issue as soon as possible. If there are any troubleshooting steps I can take on my end, please let me know.

Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter.
