Subject: Clarification Needed on Schedule Section in Figma Design

Hi Peter,

Could you please review and provide a detailed explanation of the **Schedule** section according to the Figma design? Specifically, we need clarity on the **start date** and **end date** fields to ensure we're aligned with the intended flow and functionality.

In ADO, there seem to be several confusing points related to this story. Could you please summarize these details efficiently so we have a clear understanding moving forward?

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
