Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have experienced a sudden and unfortunate loss in my family. My uncle has passed away, and I need to take some time off to attend to the necessary arrangements and be with my family during this difficult time.

I understand the importance of my responsibilities at work, and I will ensure that my current projects are handed over smoothly. I plan to be away from [start date] to [end date]. I believe that I will be able to resume work on [return date].

I appreciate your understanding and support during this challenging period. Please let me know if there are any formalities or procedures I need to follow in relation to my leave.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
