Subject: Discrepancy Between Backend Payload and UI Design in ADO

Hi Peter,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to bring to your attention that the payload provided by the backend team is not matching the UI design attached in the ADO. It seems that either the UI flow is not correct, or the payload itself is incorrect.

In the ADO, Iâ€™ve already mentioned that the company selection should drive the selection of userRole, billingAccess, adminAccess, and analyticsAccess for each company. 

Could you please confirm from where we are populating the company in each row of the table and on what basis this is being done?

Also, could you update the ADO with more detailed information regarding this issue?

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
