Subject: Request for Appraisal Rating Increase

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss my current appraisal rating and bring to your attention the significant effort and dedication our team has invested in the ongoing project.

Over the past months, our team has consistently gone above and beyond to meet project milestones and deliverables. The collective hard work and commitment have not only resulted in successful outcomes but have also demonstrated our team's capability to handle challenges effectively.

Considering the extraordinary efforts put forth by the team, I would like to kindly request a reconsideration of my appraisal rating. I believe that an adjustment in line with our performance on the current project would be a fair acknowledgment of our dedication and achievements.

I appreciate your time and consideration on this matter and am open to discussing it further at your convenience.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
