Subject: Request to Continue Working from Home Due to Health Reasons

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request to continue working from home due to ongoing health issues. As you are aware, I have been receiving homeopathic treatment for some time, a matter I discussed during my interview, and was assured of the company's understanding and support.

Given my past performance metrics and positive feedback, which highlight my ability to successfully work remotely, I believe continuing to work from home is in the best interest of my health and my productivity. Once my health improves, I will transition back to working from the office.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
