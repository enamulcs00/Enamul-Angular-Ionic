Subject: Request for 5 Days Leave Due to Family Emergency

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a family emergency that requires my immediate attention. Unfortunately, my uncle has passed away suddenly, and I need to be with my family during this difficult time.

I am requesting a leave of absence for the next five days, starting from [start date] to [end date], to support my family and attend necessary arrangements. I understand the importance of my role and will ensure a smooth transition of my responsibilities before my departure.

I will do my best to complete any pending tasks and hand over relevant information to [colleague's name] to minimize disruption during my absence. I appreciate your understanding and support during this challenging period.

Please let me know if there are any specific procedures or documentation required for such situations. I am available to discuss this further if needed.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Position]
