wSubject: Half-Day Leave Notification - Court Appointment

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that I have a court appointment related to property formalities tomorrow morning, and I will be available only from the second half of the day. I have already applied for a half-day leave on Ultimatix to accommodate this.

I assure you that I will manage my work efficiently upon my return in the afternoon. Please let me know if there are any urgent tasks that need immediate attention before my leave.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Position]
