Subject: Request to Continue Working from Home

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to request continued permission to work from home due to ongoing health issues. As you are aware, I have been undergoing treatment with homeopathic medicine for some time now. This matter was discussed during my interview, and it was agreed that I could work from home until my condition improves.

Given the current state of my health, I believe it is best for me to maintain this arrangement until I feel better and can return to the office. I am committed to fulfilling all my responsibilities and will ensure that my work remains unaffected during this period.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
