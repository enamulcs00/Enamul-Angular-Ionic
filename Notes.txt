Subject: Leave Request for Eid Celebration

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request approval for a planned leave to celebrate Eid with my family. I would like to take leave from June 17, 2024, to June 21, 2024, and return to work on June 24, 2024.

I have ensured that all my current projects and tasks will be either completed or properly handed over to my colleagues before my leave. I will also be available via email or phone for any urgent matters during my absence.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my request. Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any additional steps I need to take.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
