**Subject:** Clarification Required: "Who Can See This Banner" Details  

Hi Peter,  

I hope this email finds you well.  

Could you please explain in detail how the "Who Can See This Banner" functionality is intended to work? Specifically, we would like to understand the factors determining the list in the drop-down for "Who Can See This Banner."  

Currently, we observe that the following drop-downs are functioning independently:  
- **Company**  
- **Service**  
- **Product Tier**  
- **Business Model**  

We need your guidance to confirm which of these options should populate the "Who Can See This Banner" drop-down. For example:  
- Will it display the selected company?  
- Will it reflect the selected service?  
- Or will it be tied to the selected business model or product tier?  

Additionally, it would be helpful if you could provide some screenshots or visuals to clarify this behavior further. This would ensure that we’re aligned on expectations.  

Looking forward to your input.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Job Title]  
[Your Contact Information]

Let me know if you’d like any further refinements!
