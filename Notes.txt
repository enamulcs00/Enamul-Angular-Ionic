Subject: Sonar Issue - High Cognitive Complexity in [File Name] - Separate Story Needed

Hi [Manager Name],

I'm writing to inform you about a critical Sonar issue I identified in [File Name] during our ongoing vulnerability fixes.

The code in this file has a cognitive complexity of 223, which significantly exceeds the maximum allowed threshold of 15. This high complexity indicates very intricate code that's difficult to understand, maintain, and potentially prone to errors.

Due to the complexity of this code, addressing the Sonar issue will likely require more time than the current vulnerability fixes we're working on. To ensure we can dedicate the necessary resources and avoid delays, I recommend creating a separate story specifically for tackling this high cognitive complexity issue.

This separate story will allow us to:

* Clearly define the scope and effort required to address the high complexity.
* Prioritize and schedule the fix appropriately.
* Avoid potential delays in the ongoing vulnerability fixes.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further or if you have any questions.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
