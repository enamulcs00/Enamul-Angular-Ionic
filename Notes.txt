Subject: Request to Re-Run Jenkins Build for Bug Fix in Production

Hi Chinmaya,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to inform you about a bug that I fixed during the last sprint. The fix has been working as expected up to the UAT environment. However, we have observed that the issue persists in the Production environment.

To resolve this, could you please run the Jenkins build for the Production environment once again? Re-running the build should apply the bug fix and ensure that it functions correctly in Production as well.

Thank you for your assistance with this. Please let me know if you need any further information.

Best regards,
