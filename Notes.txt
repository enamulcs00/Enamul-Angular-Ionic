Subject: Urgent: Bug Report - Null AccountType from API

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention an issue we've encountered with one of our APIs. Upon investigation, it appears that the API is returning a null value for the AccountType field in certain requests, leading to unexpected behavior in our system.

After consulting with the team, we believe that this issue requires attention from our backend team to investigate and address the root cause. It seems to be impacting the functionality of our application and may potentially affect user experience.

Could you please reassign this bug report to the backend team for further investigation and resolution? If there are any additional resources or information needed from my end, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
