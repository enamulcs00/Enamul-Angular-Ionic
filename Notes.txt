Subject: User Story #178348 Ready for QA Testing (Except Task #179039)

Hi QA Team,

User story #178348 is now completed and available in the QA environment for testing.

Please note that task #179039 is still in progress due to a large number of required refactors. However, this task's incompletion should not impact your ability to test the overall functionality of user story #178348.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,

The Development Team**  **
